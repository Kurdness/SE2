            //I created a third branch called "class-b" and I merged it with branch "master" as well.
            // Now, branch "class-b" can see all the changes but branch "master" only sees the first change and branch "class-c" sees - 
            //the first and the second change.

            //Now that I have pulled requests from both branches "class-c" and "class-b" 
            //I can see that the changes appeared to branch "class-b" were also the same changes that appeared to branch "master" but not to branch "class-c"
